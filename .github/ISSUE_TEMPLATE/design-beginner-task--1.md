# Project 1: Shadow Workflow
*This is a general outline. Some parts of the project may take longer than others and deadlines depend on team availability and the hard deadline of project.*

## 0: Receive project brief
- [ ] We will all be assigned a task and take notes on what the Client Wants
  - ex. Daniel says "I want a group of students working together" etc.
## 1: Research
- [ ] Research background info on anything relevant to the project (and take short notes if necessary)
  - [ ] What is the graphic about?
  - ex. if Daniel says "Covid19 and Twitter API", look into both topics and learn about what they do/the purpose. Be able to describe what we are trying to communicate with the graphic.
"Covid19 and Twitter API" -> "using code to process large amounts of data to analyze trends/ correlations between Covid19 and human behavior"
  - [ ]  Who is the graphic for?
  - ex. if we are making a graphic for college students, research what those kinds of graphics look like
- [ ] What are some graphics that successfully communicate something similar or relevant to the main concept?
  - ex. how have other designers shown people working together? coding to create a project? using data to visualize concepts? etc.
- [ ] Save these reference imgs.
- [ ] Create a report of your research to the team (in a meeting)

## 2: Brainstorm/Sketches
- [ ] After discussing research, team will brainstorm and generate an overall concept/list of necessary elements in the graphic
  - ex. TwitterAPI and Covid graphic needs:
  1. students collaborating
  2. coding
  3. sense of location/real world application
- [ ] Create at least 3 sketches of possible graphics. Share and discuss with team, proceed to finalize sketch.

## 3: First Iteration
- After finalizing sketch, team will delegate illustration work accordingly.
- [ ] Use Adobe Illustrator to illustrate what you were assigned to create. Keep in mind that the team needs to be able to make alterations like changing the shape or color of the object.
- [ ] Present your first draft, receive feedback.

## 4: Second Iteration
- [ ] Incorporate feedback and continue working in Illustrator. Present work and receive feedback.

## 5: Finalize Design
- [ ] Clean up the Illustrator file if necessary (delete any unused layers or objects) and export graphics as svg and png.
