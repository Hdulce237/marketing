Hey there!



My name is [name] and I'm part of a tech education organization at UC Davis called Bit Project



We are currently developing a Learning Management System used to teach students industry standard skills so that they will be ready when they enter tech industries


**THIS NEXT LINE NEEDS TO BE TAILORED**
I was really impressed by the tutoring sessions you have planned out for this quarter and think it's it would be an awesome opportunity for some of the students we work with to get involved



I'd love to set up meeting to discuss this with you sometime this or next week



Please let me know if you'd be interested!
