Hi,

My name is [NAME] and I am a Growth Marketing Partner at a UC Davis student-run organization called Bit Project (bitproject.org). We work to democratize STEM education for all students. We are currently looking to partner with student organizations like yours to create and distribute open-source technical educational resources to students from around the world.

We work with leading companies like MongoDB, Twitter, and Postman to develop curriculum on a broad range of topics such as Web Development, Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Blockchain and would love to work with you on similar workshops. You can find our open projects on our website: bitproject.org/join.

Please let me know if youâ€™d be interested in discussing this further and we can set up a Zoom meeting.

Thanks,  
[NAME]
