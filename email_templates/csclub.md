Hi,

My name is [NAME] and I am a Growth Marketing Partner at a UC Davis student-run organization called Bit Project. We work to democratize STEM education for all students. We partner with student organizations like yours to create and distribute open-source technical educational resources to students from around the world.  We work with leading companies like MongoDB, Twitter, and Postman to develop curriculum on a broad range of topics such as Web Development, Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Blockchain. I’d love to set up a call sometime this week to give you more information or discuss this further. Please let me know if you’d be interested.

Thanks,
