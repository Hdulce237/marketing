Hi ______,
I am contacting you as a representative of Bit Project (bitproject.org), a 100% student-run organization developing an open source technical education initiative to make tech ed more accessible to all. We develop collaborative, interactive workshops to make learning data science and its applications easier and more intuitive for both students and professors.
We are currently trying to get a better understanding on the opinions of the current learning process in data science from both professors and grad students, and I would love to set up a meeting with you to get your feedback on our workshops.
Please let me know if you’re available for a quick call this week and I’d love to set it up.
Thank you so much for your time and I hope to hear from you soon!
Best,
__________
