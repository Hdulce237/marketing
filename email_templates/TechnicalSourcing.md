Bit Project, a fully REMOTE student initiative created to make technical education more accessible, is recruiting Technical Sourcers to join our team. 

Bit Project was founded at UC Davis in September 2019. Since its launch, over 100 passionate students have joined together to bring unique learning experiences to students in underserved communities. We work with industry partners and world-class UC Davis faculty to create fun, interactive content in the form of workshops, classroom experiences, and bootcamps. 

As a Technical Sourcer, your role is to source and hire candidates for open positions within Bit. By crafting and sending recruitment emails, interacting with potential candidates on online networks, and conducting interviews, you will help strengthen our team to grow Bit Project to the next level.
