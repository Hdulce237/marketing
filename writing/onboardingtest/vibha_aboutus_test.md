We make software engineering and computer science education accessible to students from non-traditional learning environments. Using our curriculum, we take students with minimal experience in computer science and help them grow to become full-fledged software developers. We collaborate with leading companies and developers to create interactive and fun technical content that uses industry standard technologies and developer tools.



This paragraph gives an introduction to the Bit Project. It describes the overall mission of the project and highlights its focus and future goals. Changes: reworking the structure of the 2nd sentence and eliminating any redundant phrases.

Strengths: The paragraph is very straightfoward and concise, which makes it easier to understand. It is organized and first describes its mission. It then leads to how it fulfills its mission, and then how it will continue its mission in the future.

Weaknesses: Some terms can be more clear (to what extent I'm not sure), like "non-traditional learning environments". Maybe clarify the difference between "industry standard technologies" and "developer tools". Also mention what the target group of students is!
