 Using NoSQL to Power Student Developer Projects
## How MongoDB and Bit Project Are Collaborating to Make NoSQL Database Technologies More Accessible Than Ever to Students

### Overview: 

Bit Project is a student-run organization based in UC Davis that provides an open-source education platform in which students 
around the world collaborate to develop and find workshops in to learn about industry-standard technical subjects. Our mission is to
democratize technical education by empowering students to develop interactive learning experiences that support collaboration 
and make education accessible for all.

MongoDB is an open-source, documentation-focused database program that lets users store data without worrying about the 
complications of structuring data. Unlike traditional databases, data are stored as separate documents in collections in MongoDB 
rather than in rows and columns. MongoDB is the industry leader in NoSQL databases - non-relational databases that store and retrieve 
data through keys and values. NoSQL is relatively new, but is more flexible and approachable than SQL. MongoDB makes learning 
and understanding database management simple for students with little to no experience with complex CS concepts through 
user-friendly features. 

###  Why We Partnered With MongoDB:

At Bit Project, we strive to deliver the most up-to-date technical knowledge to students and underrepresented audiences through
our curriculum. In particular, our Head of Developer Relations, Kevin Vuong, has been at the forefront of the collaboration. 
Leading a team of developers to incorporate companies’ developer tools into curriculum lets him observe technologies that are 
becoming more mainstream in the tech industry. MongoDB’s novel, user-friendly services certainly fit what Vuong, and Bit Project 
as a whole, was looking for. “Traditionally, we use SQL to manage databases, which is very streamlined and structured. But,
NoSQL allows for more flexibility and is a more modern technology”, Vuong explains, “What’s so amazing about the MongoDB team
is that they’re really the industry leaders in NoSQL, and we wanted to get their expertise and input on making any NoSQL 
or MongoDB content.” 

Our main goal was to bring MongoDB's database technology to a demographic that will surely need them in the future. According to
Vuong, the lack of NoSQL content in current college level computer science (CS) courses can put students at a disadvantage 
in pursuing CS careers. “SQL has been the industry standard for 20, 25 years, so it’s traditionally taught in universities, 
but it’s not very easy to learn at first,” he states, “Everything you can do with SQL, you can do with NoSQL.” Due to the lack of 
of attention for NoSQL in the academia, we wanted to bring MongoDB’s technology to passionate students who want 
to learn about databases but don’t have the means to do so so that they can pursue their own interests and 
build new and innovative projects.

Recently, MongoDB launched MongoDB University, a free educational program for university students to take courses on NoSQL 
technology and practice for developer and database administrator (DBA) exams. “After looking at the MongoDB courses, we wanted
to make them even more interactive, beginner-friendly, and accessible to not just technical majors, but non-tech students as
well,” Vuong says. We decided to expand upon MongoDB’s educational efforts by hosting a university-wide workshop open to anyone 
about MongoDB databases and how they apply to everyday life.

### Planning and Execution:

To create the workshop, developers developed an interactive scavenger hunt spanning the entire workshop event that taught 
students fundamental NoSQL concepts and how they applied to MongoDB. The activity taught workshop students about different 
types of queries - data requested from a database. The developers created the activity on a website with instructions 
for the workshop, and worked with MongoDB to create PowerPoint slides for the workshop. MongoDB  reviewed all the workshop 
activities and provided constructive feedbacks on clarity and usage of MongoDB products. For any specific issues developers 
had while creating the workshop, MongoDB guided them towards helpful resources, such as links to MongoDB University courses,
to clear up any confusion. 

The actual workshop began with an introduction to databases, NoSQL and their importance to the industry. Next, we discussed
the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases and made analogies to each to familiarize students with both. 
Afterwards, we introduced MongoDB Atlas, a program that lets users host their database online without needing to code 
beforehand. Using the sample database they prepared in Atlas, the students were taught to search for and execute multiple 
types of queries, which perform certain functions within the database to find, add, or delete information. The students were asked
to use the queries to find all the letters of a word; once found, they could proceed to the next activity page. 

At first, many attendees had questions about databases’ significance, as well as the differences between SQL and NoSQL. Most of
the students were familiar with SQL, but had not used it in a while. During the scavenger hunt activity and throughout the 
workshop, the audience asked helpful questions about the use of queries to fulfill the activity’s goals. 

### Results: 

Overall, the reception of the workshop was very positive. The students were enthusiastic learners and active participants in
all the Q&As or discussions that took place. MongoDB also provided lots of tchotchkes, such as waterproof stickers and enamel pins,
which the students really enjoyed. As a student organization, we at Bit Project have also learned a great deal from our 
collaboration with MongoDB. Being able to partner with a major player in the tech industry sets us apart from other 
organizations in that the content we deliver to our audiences by going through a credible primary source. Working with MongoDB 
also allowed us to teach industry-standard concepts to those who need or want to learn them in a relatable way, as opposed to 
typical college CS courses which use examples exclusively within a set curriculum or textbook. Our collaboration lets us 
bring actual skills and issues that appear in the tech industry to our audience. 

### Plans for the Future:

We would love to collaborate with MongoDB for future workshops, but we would like to progress to teaching more in-depth concepts. 
While teaching the basics of MongoDB and NoSQL is important, it is equally as crucial to introduce students to more complex 
features, skills, and problems that arise after learning the basics. We would also like to integrate MongoDB University courses
into our educational resources and make those especially accessible and relatable for university students who lack technical experience. 
Through a future collaboration, we believe that both Bit Project and MongoDB will be able to better achieve our goals of making technical education more accessible and approachable to a larger university student network than ever before. We look forward to seeing what our partnership with MongoDB has to offer in the future.

# Abstract: 
  A documentation recording an already delivered workshop, detailing our purpose, work with MongoDB and how we move forward from the event
  
# Changes:
* Separate the open source and the workshops as two products in overview
* data structure changed into structuring data (the original is likely to be confused with the topic)
* some grammartical errors and changes in word choices
* fixed structural and technical errors for overview description for MongoDB (it's "keys and values" not "key values")
* it's not that MongoDB is "inaccessible", it is not being taught but everyone can still access it if they have a computer
* distinguish the MongoDB team to the product itself because they have different pronouns
* the part connecting mongoDB to student's needs is half-parallel to the second part, I changed it to a direct chain of cause and effect
* emphasis a little bit more on the distinction between our workshop and mongoDB university
* the whole planning and execution section has some redundance and confusing parts, I made some changes that hopefully keeps the ideas
* regrouped some sentences to make each sentence more focused on a purpose to deliver

# Strengths:
* detailed in describing the implementation of the workshop, the clarity of our relation to MongoDB in the collaborate process is very good
* very clear sectioning, all the areas that I could think of is covered and easy to find
* gives thoughts to the takeaways and how we can move forward in the future

# Weaknesses: (mostly clarity issues but doesn't affect the main takeaway too much)
* a little bit confusing on the event planning and execution still: so if participants don't finish finding the data, then they can't go to the next event? That sounds a little bit frustrating. My suggestion is to either rephrase it as:
  a. workshop leaders would help them work it out
  b. it's a game to see how far you can get with the tasks
* it is a bit unclear what our plans are and how we view MongoDB university. College students already have access to MongoDB university so how can we make it "our thing"? (maybe groupchats to help each other and study sessions together?)
* some unclear parts that I've worked with, I assume that is what it is supposed to mean but can't guarentee it (what does "tchotchkes" mean, is that a typo?)
