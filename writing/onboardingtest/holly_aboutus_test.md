# About Us
We make software engineering and computer science education accessible to students from nontraditional learning environments.
Our curriculum helps students ranging from minimal experience in computer science to a full-fledged software developer with 
a diverse coding portfolio. We collaborate with leading companies and developers to create interactive and
fun technical contents that use industry standard technologies and developer tools.

#abastract:

#changes:
* delete the "using" in "using our curriculum", clear out the repetition, and get rid of some other parts to create a more direct relationship between the users
and our products, and simply state the user groups.
* interactive and fun should be jointed by "and" instead of comma because it is only two items
* adding "s" after content

#strengths:
* short and easy to read
* all audience can understand it with or without technical background
* the contents sound appealing

#weaknesses:
* being more concrete with the companies that we're collaborating with would help with the appeal
* while it looks like it is targetting students from "nontraditional learning environment", seems like it could be for everyone especially that?
* can think about elaborating on topics of sample courses to show that we have some advanced topics that they can eventually get to
