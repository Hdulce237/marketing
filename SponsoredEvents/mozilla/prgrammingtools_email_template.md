# Non-CS Major Advisors:

My name is Iris Zhong, a representative of the student-run organization Bit Project. Our mission is to make technical education accessible to all students. We strive to democrative technical education so that anyone in the United States has an equal opportunity to enter the tech world. Our team of student developers have created various STEM curriculum, partnering with companies such as Twitter and Postman to develop some them. 

Bit Project is partnering with Mozilla and Internet of Things Entrepreneur, Kathy Giori, for an interactive workshop to explore programming improvement tools and WebThings, a Mozilla software framework to tie physical computing data to the web.

Jumping straight into a new text-based programming language, as a means to solve even a simple technical problem, can be a daunting task, because you have to learn syntax and procedural aspects of the language before it becomes an effective tool. 

Exploring two programming environments to explore software programming for beginners and "physical computing", programming microcontrollers, to interact with the physical world around you.
- Snap!
- MicroBlocks (physical computing)

And finally, this webinar will briefly introduce an excellent software framework to tie physical computing data to the web. The Mozilla WebThings project stands out proudly!

- WebThings Gateway
- WebThings Framework
Using example libraries, your Internet of Things (IoT) devices can easily be defined using a "Web of Things" JSON-formatted "Thing Description". That W3C WoT standard allows the physical world to be brought to the web, in a standard way, for easy interoperability across all devices and languages used to create them.

Join this webinar to start you on your own programming improvement journey and education others!
