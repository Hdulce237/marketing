Hi Professor,

Thank you for posting our flyer! Hope you are doing well. Amidst COVID 19, we have had a few professors reach out to us for educational content they can integrate into their classroom. Therefore, as an educational resource, we are currently developing webinars led by a panel of professors, students, and industry partners about the importance of integrating real life hands-on experience into the classroom for [class] courses. We would love it if you could lend your expertise on this topic.
I’m CC’ing Shreya Gupta who will be organizing the webinar for more information.

I'd love to get a chance to talk to you about the vision of our webinar and get your insight. I'd specifically like to ask you about the process of going remote for college level classes, what resources you currently have available or would need to provide your students with hands-on experience within the Communications fields, and how integrating project-based workshops similar to the ones that our student developers are creating would benefit professors in such a time.

I'd really appreciate getting a change to discuss this with you over a Zoom call. Would you be available sometime this week for this?

Best,
